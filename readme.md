# SimpleGP #

**NOTE:** Unfortunately the code in this solution is still very much intertwined with _Code.Dash_, which is still very much a work in progress. This means that some "hacking" is required to get the code working (remove the calls to CodeBase and the database elements). I intend to fix this once the _Code.Dash_ solution is up and running properly.

## What is it ##

_SimpleGP_ is a solution designed to run on top of GeneticLib and implements the Grammar elements to perform generation of C++ functions to solve for test cases defined in an input ARFF file. More details to come!
